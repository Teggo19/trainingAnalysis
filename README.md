# trainingAnalysis
An attempt to make training make training data systematic and gain something from the data analysis.

I am currently working on how to make the data viable to data analysis. I have done a little testing on some old training data, but the usage of this analysis is very limited as the data is very small and lack quality.

If you want a look at what I have done with the old data, take a look in the notebook.ipynb
